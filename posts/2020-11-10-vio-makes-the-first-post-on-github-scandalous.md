Since the last time I have refined my #dhquestion for the Final project. I decided to focus on creating the narratives of a few of the educated women as different “prototypes” of that time (below I talk later about how I chose them) and then exploring how relatable they are to us - modern people.  
One of the effective ways to visualize data is to make it relatable on the individual level, like what we have seen in the big data visualization of 2016 US elections, when one could zoom in as close as their neighborhood and explore the voting results. Additionally, the science of learning outlines making and using associations as the core learning principle (Kosslyn, 2017). Thus, if my final goal is not only to entertain but also to educate, invoking associations with past or present personal experiences will instigate better memory of the content and hopefully a reader will be able to retrieve some knowledge in the future.
